                  <p>
                  In 5th Grade we had to do a Passion Project. My passion is the ocean. So I knew exactly what I wanted to do. We researched for 6 monthes and then I had my speech. It was my first big speech ever. I had worked very hard on practicing and working on my slides. I still remember the amazing feeling of talking about something I love.
