                  <strong> Hawaii </strong>
                  <p> I have gone to Hawaii since I was about 1 years old. We used to go about every two years and would go for about two weeks. Here are a couple things that I loved doing in Hawaii. </p>
                  <li> I would love to go bogie boarding and standup paddleboarding on the ocean with my sister and dad. </li>
                  <li> On the beach I would love to build sand castels and relax with my family. </li>
                  <li> At night the sunsets are beautiful so I love to sit and watch the sky intill it sets. </li>
                  <li> We would go to a Luau and it is very special time with my family. I love Hawaii and it is my favorite vacation ever. </li>
                </ul>
