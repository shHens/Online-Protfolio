I have gone to a ballet studio since I was three years old and now go two times a week. My goal is to go on pointe but I have to work very hard to reach that goal. Doing ballet is very hard work. Going on point can be scary and you can even hurt yourself pretty bad. I do tumbling on Saturdays and they are a lot of fun. Right now I am working on round-offs and backward rolls. In my free time, I read a lot. A few of my favorite series are Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, and Keeper of the Lost Cities. I have read so many different types of books but my favorite is fantasy and adventure books.

Ever since I started Elementary school I knew that I loved animals and ocean animals were grabbing my interest. So in 4th grade, it became clear that I wanted to become a Marine Biologist. I also love kids so I want to work at an aquarium. When I was nine years old we took a trip to Hawaii and I loved it. For a while, I really wanted to go to college there. While we were there we went to an aquarium and I remember that they said that you can go swimming with sharks at age 12 with a parent and at age 18 you can go alone. At these words, I really wanted to go but I was not old enough. Now I am 12 years old I cant wait to go to Hawaii and swim with sharks. Thank you for reading about me.
